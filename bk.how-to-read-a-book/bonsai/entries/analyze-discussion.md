: tldr  :: "order the discussion to determine the truth buried beneath; truth may not be reached in the end, but the analysis can clear away the deadwood for future work to continue."

: synonym :: [[dialectic]]


- don't forget to [[put-truth-first]]: [[truth]] is to be found in the conflict of opposing answers.
- it is not about finding the right answer, but engaging in a discussion in which truth can emerge.
- thus, syntopical reading can "clear away the deadwood"; if no answers are found, the way may be paved for future discussions to discover them.
